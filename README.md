# NFL-Draft-Predictions
Predicting round of draftee from combine performance

## Project Goal:
   #### Predicting whether (and in which round) a given combine performer will be drafted based upon their results at the event
## Process:
   #### Scrape data from past 20 year of combine performances
   #### Clean player names, school names, and impute universally valid values (round 8 for undrafted players, 22 for mean age)
   #### Handle more crucial missing values by imputing a postional mean with a penatly of .5 standard deviations (add/sub depending on event)
   #### Explore relationships in the cleaned data - scatter matrix, barplot, histogram, etc
   #### Apply a range of modeling techniques such as Random Forest, K-Nearest-Neighbors, and XGBoost to make predictions (both binary and multi)
##  Repo Contents

   #### NFL-Draft-Predictions Notebook - includes both binary-class (drafted/undrafted) and multi-class (round drafted)
   #### Further-Investigations - does incorporating college production and twitter sentiment help improve accuracy of models?

- ### Conclusion / Results

- #### Best Binary Classifier (i.e. drafted vs undrafted): Random Forest with an F1 score of .795
- #### Best Multi Classifier (i.e. predict round drafted): Random Forest with an F1 score of .361
